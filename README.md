🚀 ProjectMentor
Your Guide Through Real Projects

Understand. Learn. Evaluate.
ProjectMentor helps students, interns, and newly joined developers quickly understand real-world codebases and evaluate their understanding in a structured, confidence-building way.

🧠 Problem Statement

Understanding an existing project is one of the hardest challenges for:

🎓 Students working on academic or open-source projects

🧑‍💻 Interns onboarding into unfamiliar codebases

👩‍💼 New employees joining fast-moving engineering teams

Most tools today:

Explain code line by line, not concept by concept

Are editor-centric (Cursor, Copilot) and not learning-centric

Don’t evaluate real understanding of a project

👉 ProjectMentor bridges this gap.

💡 Solution

ProjectMentor transforms any project into a guided learning and evaluation experience.

It allows users to:

Explore a project safely (read-only)

Learn specific parts (Frontend / Backend / DB / Architecture)

Understand why files exist, not just what they contain

Evaluate understanding using real project logic (not theory)

✨ Key Features
📁 Project Exploration

Upload project ZIP or connect GitHub repo (mocked in MVP)

Clean project hierarchy view

Read-only code viewer

File-level explanations:

Why this file exists

What problem it solves

Where it fits in the architecture

🎓 Learning Mode (Guided & Focused)

Tech-stack based learning paths

User selects what to learn:

🎨 Frontend

⚙ Backend

🗄 Database

🏗 Architecture

Only relevant files & folders are shown

3-panel learning UI:

File Tree (filtered)

Full Code View (read-only)

Context Panel:

Why this file exists

Important functions / snippets

Queries & issues

Progress tracking with “Mark as Understood”

🧪 Evaluation Mode (Beyond Quizzes)

User selects:

Area to evaluate (Frontend / Backend / DB / Full Project)

Difficulty level (Beginner → Advanced)

Beginner & Intermediate:

Scenario-based questions

Real project code context

Advanced:

Editable code challenges

User modifies code

AI (planned) evaluates changes

Post-evaluation:

Strengths & weaknesses

Actionable learning suggestions

Option to relearn weak areas

🖥️ Demo Flow (Hackathon MVP)

Open ProjectMentor

Click Connect Repo / Upload ZIP

Sign in (Mocked: Google / GitHub / Email)

Upload project → System “scans” project

Explore project structure & files

Choose Learn → Select Frontend

Learn files step-by-step

Switch to Evaluate → Answer real project questions

Receive feedback & next steps

🛠 Tech Stack (Current MVP)
Frontend

⚛ React

🎨 Tailwind CSS

🌗 Light & Dark Mode

🧭 React Router

🧠 Context / State Management

Backend & AI (Planned)

FastAPI

Tree-sitter (code parsing)

Ollama / LLMs (AI explanations & evaluation)

⚠️ Note:
This hackathon MVP focuses on UX, flow, and product thinking.
AI & backend are intentionally mocked to validate the idea first.

🆚 How ProjectMentor Is Different
