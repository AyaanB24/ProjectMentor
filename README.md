# 🚀 ProjectMentor
**Your Guide Through Real Projects**  

**Understand. Learn. Evaluate.**  

ProjectMentor helps **students, interns, and newly joined developers** quickly understand real-world codebases and evaluate their understanding in a **structured, confidence-building way**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Understanding an existing project is one of the hardest challenges for:

- 🎓 **Students** working on academic, hackathons or open-source projects  
- 🧑‍💻 **Interns** onboarding into unfamiliar codebases  
- 👩‍💼 **New employees** joining fast-moving engineering teams  

Most tools today:  

- Explain code **line by line**, not concept by concept  
- Are **editor-centric** (Cursor, Copilot) and not learning-centric  
- Don’t evaluate **real understanding** of a project  

**👉 ProjectMentor bridges this gap.**

---

## 💡 Solution
ProjectMentor transforms **any project** into a **guided learning and evaluation experience**.

It allows users to:

- Explore a project safely (**read-only**)  
- Learn specific parts (**Frontend / Backend / DB / Architecture**)  
- Understand **why files exist**, not just what they contain  
- Evaluate understanding using **real project logic** (not theory)  

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 📁 Project Exploration
- Upload project **ZIP** or connect **GitHub repo** (mocked in MVP)  
- Clean **project hierarchy view**  
- **Read-only code viewer**  
- **File-level explanations**:  
  - Why this file exists  
  - What problem it solves  
  - Where it fits in the architecture  

### 🎓 Learning Mode (Guided & Focused)
- **Tech-stack based learning paths**  
- User selects what to learn:  
  - 🎨 Frontend  
  - ⚙ Backend  
  - 🗄 Database  
  - 🏗 Architecture  
- Only **relevant files & folders** are shown  
- **3-panel learning UI**:  
  1. File Tree (filtered)  
  2. Full Code View (read-only)  
  3. Context Panel:  
     - Why this file exists  
     - Important functions / snippets  
     - Queries & issues  
- Progress tracking with **“Mark as Understood”**

### 🧪 Evaluation Mode (Beyond Quizzes)
- User selects:  
  - Area to evaluate (**Frontend / Backend / DB / Full Project**)  
  - Difficulty level (**Beginner → Advanced**)  
- **Beginner & Intermediate**: Scenario-based questions, real project code context  
- **Advanced**: Editable code challenges, AI evaluates changes (planned)  
- Post-evaluation:  
  - Strengths & weaknesses  
  - Actionable learning suggestions  
  - Option to relearn weak areas

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Current)

**Frontend**  
- ⚛ React  
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS (Light & Dark Mode)  
- 🧭 React Router  
- 🧠 Context / State Management  

**Backend & AI (Planned)**  
- FastAPI  
- Tree-sitter (code parsing)  
- Ollama / LLMs (AI explanations & evaluation)  
- PostgreSQL  
- Vector Search (FAISS)  
- GitHub OAuth  

**⚠ Note:**  
This hackathon MVP focuses on **UX, flow, and product thinking**.  
AI & backend are **intentionally mocked** to validate the idea first.
